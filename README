Project from UT Distributed Computing class Fall '15

Uses the bayou protocol to manage a playlist mockup.

The code structure is somewhat ad-hoc because I was figuring out the basics of network programming and multiprocessing with Python on my own at the time.

The project is set up so that the main script can arbitrarily create or break connections between the servers and can order the clients to send or request songs.

This code is old and may have issues. It was uploaded as-is.
